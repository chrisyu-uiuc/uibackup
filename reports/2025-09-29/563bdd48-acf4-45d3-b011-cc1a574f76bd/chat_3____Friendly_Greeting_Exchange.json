  "educational_assessment": {
    "performance_comment": "The user demonstrated basic English communication skills by initiating a simple conversation and using common greetings, which shows an understanding of fundamental interaction. However, the conversation included non-English phrases and repetitive questions, indicating a need for more varied language use.",
    "correction": "The phrase 'How do you hear me' should be corrected to 'Can you hear me?' for proper grammar and meaning. Additionally, the use of non-English text like '嬉呢啲' and '希嗲' should be avoided in English practice to maintain clarity and focus on language learning.",
    "improvement_areas": "Focus on expanding vocabulary beyond basic greetings to include more diverse expressions, such as asking about well-being or surroundings. Practice forming complete sentences and using correct question structures, like starting with auxiliary verbs for yes/no questions.",
    "encouragement": "Great job starting the conversation with confidence—keep practicing regularly to build fluency and comfort. Your willingness to engage in dialogue is a strong foundation for mastering English; stay motivated and you'll see continuous progress!"
