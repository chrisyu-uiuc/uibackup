  "educational_assessment": {
    "performance_comment": "Your English performance shows a clear effort to initiate and engage in conversation, with generally understandable language. However, there are minor grammatical issues that slightly affect clarity, but your willingness to communicate is a strength.",
    "correction": "In the phrase 'What kinds of topic do you want to talk?', it should be corrected to 'What kind of topics do you want to talk about?' to improve grammar and accuracy. Other parts of the conversation, like the repetition for clarity, are handled well.",
    "improvement_areas": "Focus on using correct plural forms and prepositions, such as 'topics' instead of 'topic' and adding 'about' after 'talk'. Expanding your vocabulary for common conversation starters could also enhance fluency.",
    "encouragement": "Great job taking the initiative to practice English conversation! Keep building on this foundation, as consistent effort will lead to more natural and confident communication. You're making progressâ€”stay motivated and continue learning!"
