    "performance_comment": "The user's input '太子軒咩' appears to be in Chinese, which makes it difficult to assess English language performance. This suggests a possible misunderstanding or need for clarification in the task.",
    "correction": "Since no English was used, there are no specific corrections to make. It would be helpful for the user to provide an English sentence or conversation for accurate feedback on grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation.",
    "improvement_areas": "To improve, the user should focus on practicing basic English sentences, such as greetings or simple statements, and ensure they understand the task requirements to engage in meaningful language practice.",
    "encouragement": "Don't be discouraged by this mix-up; learning a new language involves trial and error. Keep practicing English regularly, and you'll build confidence and skills over time—every effort brings you closer to fluency!"
