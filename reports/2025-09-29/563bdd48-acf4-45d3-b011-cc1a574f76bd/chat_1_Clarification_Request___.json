Here are a few examples:\n\n1. *\"I see where you're coming from, but I have a different perspective.\"*\n2. *\"I understand your point, however, I would respectfully disagree.\"*\n3. *\"That's an interesting view, but I think [your point] might be a bit different.\"*\n4. *\"I appreciate your opinion, though I believe [your opinion].\"*\n5. *\"I can see why you'd think that, but I don't quite agree.\"*\n\nBy acknowledging the other person‚Äôs point of view, you make your disagreement sound more thoughtful and less confrontational. Does this style work for what you‚Äôre aiming for?",
