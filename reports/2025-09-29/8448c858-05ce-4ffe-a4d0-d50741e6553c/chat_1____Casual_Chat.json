  "educational_assessment": {
    "performance_comment": "The user demonstrated a basic greeting with 'hi', which is appropriate for informal contexts, but the repetition 'hihihihihihihiihihihihihihihi' lacks clarity and does not contribute to meaningful communication. Overall, this shows an attempt at engagement but needs development in forming complete thoughts.",
    "correction": "No major grammatical errors are present, as 'hi' is correctly used as a casual greeting. However, for better communication, encourage using full sentences like 'Hi, how are you?' instead of excessive repetition to practice standard language patterns.",
    "improvement_areas": "Focus on expanding vocabulary beyond simple greetings and practice forming complete sentences to enhance conversational skills. Additionally, work on using appropriate repetition only for emphasis in natural dialogue, not as a substitute for varied expressions.",
    "encouragement": "Great job starting with a common greetingâ€”this is a solid foundation for building English skills! Keep practicing daily, and you'll soon feel more confident in having full conversations. Remember, every small step brings you closer to fluency, so stay motivated and curious!"
